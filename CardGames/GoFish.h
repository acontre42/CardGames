// HOW TO PLAY GO FISH
// Each player gets a hand with 5 cards (or 7 if only two players)
// Players ask for a value, if other player doesn't have, they draw a card
// If card drawn matches the value they asked for, they go again
// Player can only ask for value that exists in their hand
// Once a player has 4 of same value, they have a book
// Books are set aside and those cards can no longer be traded
// Player with the most books at end of game wins
// if Player runs out of cards, they draw 5 (or 7 if two players) cards from play deck
// if not enough cards left in play deck, take the remainder
// if there are no cards left in play deck, this Player sits out
// game ends when no more cards in play deck or any of the Players' hands

// TO DO:
// make sure hands get sorted after every change to hand
// optional: take a turn to show players their cards after first dealing them?
// optional: consider adding a string to each Player that informs them of the moves taken against them between their turns
